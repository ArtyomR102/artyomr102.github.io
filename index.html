	<h1>Welcome to my modest hideout!</h1>
	<h2>What's this place (for)?</h2>
	<p>Just another homepage of another guy on the Internet! I just needed a place where I could post some things like software, game mods, etc. However, what am I talking about? This page is not indexed by search engines, so you probably came here with a purpose, right? Well, if so, here is some things I can offer.</p>
	<h2>My projects</h2>
